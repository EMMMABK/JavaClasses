The `Book` class models a book with four attributes: title, author, ISBN, and price. It provides two constructors wherein the default constructor initializes all the aforementioned attributes to empty values and a parameterized constructor sets their values according to the arguments supplied to it. This class also contains the displayInfo() method, which prints the details of the book in the format: title, author, ISBN, and price. Also, the method `SherlockFind()` checks if the title of the book is "The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes" and sets the price to 0 if true.

The class `Main` contains the `main()` method and is the entry point of the program. Inside the `main()`, three objects of the class `Book` are created using the parameterized constructor. The `displayInfo()` and `SherlockFind()` methods are invoked on each of the book objects. The Main class is dependent on the Book class, since it creates and manipulates Book objects. Dependency of this kind is a "creates" type; that is to say, the Main class functions with the dependence of the Book class by way of its methods, acting upon it to display even alter the book's information.
