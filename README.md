Then, I created a class `Main`, which includes the main method of this program. I created three objects of class `Book` and initialized them by calling this class constructor with different sets of such attributes as title, author, ISBN, and price. The attributes of the books are strings and integers. Further, I called the `displayInfo()` method to display each book's information. The method SherlockFind() is invoked, too, which searches for "The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes." Finally, the information of each book is printed twice: before and after calling the method SherlockFind(). With this, one can check what changes have taken place in the state of the object after calling the method.
